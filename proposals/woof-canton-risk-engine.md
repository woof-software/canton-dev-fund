# Abstract

This proposal funds the **Canton Risk Engine** — open-source risk-parameter primitives and reference implementations for Canton/Zenith DeFi protocols. It extracts and generalizes three risk-management patterns proven in production on Compound Finance — the **Configurator pattern** (on-chain parameter governance, Compound Labs' design, which Woof operates across the markets it deploys), the **CAPO oracle approach** (Correlated-Assets Price Oracle, price-induced risk handling, which Woof implemented for Compound), and the **Reserve Growth tracking model** (operational risk visibility, Woof's own work) — and ships them as Canton-native public goods that any protocol can use inside its own contracts.

**This is not a product or a hosted service.** The deliverables are MIT-licensed building blocks: an on-chain risk-parameter registry (Solidity) and open reference implementations (Solidity + DAML) that firms integrate when their contracts need these parameters — plus an optional open-source simulator and a self-hostable dashboard as tooling on top. Nothing is operated by Woof as a paid service.

**Total funding:** $150,000 USD, denominated in Canton Coin at the prevailing USD/CC rate at each milestone's acceptance, across 3 milestones. The volatility-adjustment mechanism required by CIP-0100 is set out in the Funding section.
**Duration:** 6 months across 3 milestones.

# Motivation

Canton DeFi is approaching its first production lending markets and yield vaults. At least **6 lending/vault proposals in the open Dev Fund queue** require risk parameter management before mainnet, and none of them propose to solve it themselves:

[Mystic #99](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/99), [Cantopy #235](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/235), [D2 Finance #144](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/144), [Margarita CC20 #186](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/186), [Meria #65](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/65), [Institutional Yield Segmentation #44](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/44). SafeVault ([PR #266](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/266)) sits at a higher layer (capital flow workflows) but is a natural integration partner.

The demand is not hypothetical. After we published the pre-submission write-up, Tokenisys responded publicly on the forum that they "would be interested in integrating products on this type of infrastructure", naming two concrete candidates — their token risk-rating model and a DAML option-pricing / VaR-CVaR distribution ([forum thread](https://forum.canton.network/t/woof-two-dev-fund-proposals-evm-side-compliance-risk-infrastructure-for-canton-seeking-feedback-champion/8796)).

Every one of these protocols faces the same questions before mainnet:

1. **What collateral factor** should each asset have, and how does it change as the market grows?
2. **What supply cap and borrow cap** prevents single-asset concentration?
3. **What liquidation threshold** balances borrower comfort against insolvency risk?
4. **What interest rate model curve** keeps utilization in safe bounds?
5. **How are these parameters updated** through governance without breaking active positions?
6. **What price feed integrity** is required, and how is it monitored?
7. **What reserves** does the protocol hold, and what is their growth pattern?

On Ethereum these problems were solved over 4+ years of evolution: Compound's Configurator, Aave's Risk Stewards, Gauntlet / Steakhouse / Block Analitica as commercial risk consultants. **On Canton no equivalent exists** — open-source primitives, governance patterns, simulators, dashboards. Each team rolls their own, badly, and never publishes.

This proposal addresses that shared dependency before any of them hits mainnet. We expect the Risk Engine to be evaluated by at least 50% of the lending/vault proposals listed above during M2-M3, and integrated by at least 2 of them within 6 months post-delivery.

# Specification

## 1. Objective

Ship open-source, MIT-licensed risk-parameter building blocks that any Zenith DeFi protocol can use inside its own contracts — not a product Woof operates. The core deliverables are: (a) on-chain risk-parameter primitives (a registry with standardized parameters, governance timelock, and emergency pause), and (b) reference implementations in Solidity + DAML showing how a protocol wires them in. Optional open tooling on top: (c) an off-chain simulator producing parameter-change recommendations from historical price data and stress tests, and (d) a self-hostable dashboard visualizing risk state for integrated protocols.

The scope explicitly does **not** include code-level security auditing (different domain from [Hacken #302](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/302), [DamlSec #194](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/194), [Daml Package Analyzer #130](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/130)), external rating services ([Staking Rewards #131](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/131)), or capital-flow workflows ([SafeVault #266](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/266)). Layer boundaries are explicit in the Rationale.

## 2. Implementation Mechanics

Two core deliverables — **on-chain primitives** and **reference implementations** (the public good firms build on) — plus two pieces of **optional open tooling** (simulator, dashboard). Nothing is a hosted/paid product.

### Layer 1 — On-Chain Risk Parameter Registry (Solidity, deployed on Zenith)

A permissionless on-chain registry that any Zenith DeFi protocol can integrate, storing standardized risk-parameter sets per protocol namespace with governance hooks for safe parameter updates. The parameter set below is an **illustrative reference design** showing the intended shape — the exact fields and interface surface will be finalized during M1 in consultation with the first integrating protocols.

**Standardized risk parameters (illustrative reference set):**

| Parameter | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| Collateral factor | Borrowing power granted per unit of collateral |
| Liquidation threshold | Health-factor boundary that triggers liquidation |
| Supply cap | Maximum total supply per asset (concentration limit) |
| Borrow cap | Maximum total borrow per asset |
| Reserve factor | Share of interest routed to protocol reserves |
| Interest-rate model | Reference to the asset's rate-curve contract |
| Price oracle | Reference to the asset's price source |
| Oracle staleness threshold | Maximum acceptable price age before fail-safe |
| Attestation validity window | For issuer-attested values (for example a fund NAV) rather than market feeds: maximum attestation age and a revocation check before the value may be used |
| (extension points) | CIP-56 compliance flags and protocol-specific fields |

**Registry operations (illustrative):** read the current parameter set for a given protocol/asset; propose a parameter update subject to a timelock; execute a proposed update after the timelock elapses; and emergency-pause an asset to halt new positions. The registry will cover the following functional areas (final contract decomposition driven by the cleanest, most auditable design during M1):

- **Standardized parameter storage** — a canonical, per-protocol-namespaced set of the risk parameters above.
- **Governed updates** — a propose → timelock → execute lifecycle for every parameter change.

Key design choices:
- **Configurator pattern.** Every parameter update goes through propose → timelock → execute, borrowed from Comet's Configurator architecture.
- **Per-protocol namespacing.** Mystic and Cantopy can register independently without colliding.
- **Governance-agnostic.** Supports Compound Governor, Safe multisig, or any EVM-addressable signer as authorized parameter setter. A Canton party is not an EVM address; using a Canton-side committee as setter requires an EVM-compatible adapter (a signer or relayer holding the setter role), which is out of scope for the base Registry and is scoped separately if a design partner needs it.
- **Emergency circuit breaker.** Pauses new positions while existing positions wind down safely.
- **Structured events.** Off-chain consumers (dashboards, simulators) can reconstruct full Registry state from emitted logs.

### Layer 2 — Off-Chain Risk Simulator (TypeScript + Python) — optional open tooling

Open-source simulator that consumes Registry state + oracle history and outputs recommended parameter adjustments — an open-source baseline for the core parameter-recommendation loop that protocols otherwise buy as a commercial service (Gauntlet-style).

- **Historical price replay.** Fetch oracle history (initially from Chainlink-on-Canton; from [CRDOS #155](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/155) once live).
- **Monte Carlo simulation.** Generate N future price paths from observed volatility, project insolvency risk per parameter set.
- **Stress test runner.** Apply scripted shocks (e.g. -40% in 24h, oracle delay, liquidator failure) and report which positions become unhealthy.
- **Parameter recommendation engine.** JSON-Schema-typed change proposals with justifications.
- **CI/cron mode.** Runs on a schedule, posts recommendations to a configurable webhook (Slack, GitHub Issues, governance forum).

CAPO design lineage is explicit: the simulator distinguishes between **market-price risk** (handled by parameter adjustments) and **oracle-induced risk** (handled by staleness thresholds, price anchor bands, circuit breakers). This split codifies the operational lesson from CAPO.

### Layer 3 — Risk Visualization Dashboard (React / Next.js) — optional, self-hostable tooling

Public dashboard for every registered protocol's risk state. Inspired by Aave's Risk Dashboard and Woof's own live [Compound Treasury / Reserve dashboard](https://compound.woof.software/treasury).

- Per-protocol risk snapshot — current parameters, utilization, reserves, recent governance actions.
- Historical timeline of parameter changes with attribution.
- Simulator output viewer — recommended changes alongside current values, with diff and justification.
- Interactive stress-test playground — "what if BTC drops 30%?".
- Per-party views (Canton-native) — when a protocol uses party-based visibility, the dashboard respects that scoping for authorized users.

Public good — hosted as a static site by Woof, source published so any party can self-host.

### Layer 4 — Reference Implementations (core public good)

Three production-shaped, open-source implementation examples demonstrating the parameter-governance patterns in use — two consuming the Registry on the EVM side, one Canton-native in DAML.

1. **ERC-4626 vault with risk-managed parameters** (Solidity) — a vault over an EVM-native ERC-20 underlying, consulting the Registry for supply caps and oracle staleness checks. ERC-4626 requires an ERC-20 underlying; a CIP-56 representation on Zenith EVM is a separate dependency that is agreed with the token issuer, not assumed by this deliverable. Suitable as a template for the 4+ vault proposals in the queue.
2. **Simple lending protocol with risk-managed parameters** (Solidity) — stripped-down Compound v3-shaped market using the Registry for collateral factors, liquidation thresholds, and IRM selection. Not intended to compete with Mystic or any other lending product — explicitly a reference for parameter integration.
3. **DAML risk-parameter governance example** — the same propose → timelock → execute pattern expressed as open-source DAML templates (a governed risk-parameter set plus a minimal consuming contract), runnable against a local Canton ledger. This gives Canton-native firms an OSS example to follow when their own DAML contracts require governed parameters — with no dependency on the EVM side. Because visibility on Canton is a stakeholder property, the templates also define a designated **risk-observer role**: one or more parties named at setup, made observers of the governed parameter set and of its proposal and execution records, so that risk management and monitoring can read current values and history through the Ledger API without holding any authority over them, and can be added or revoked by the governing party. The role is deliberately a small named set rather than a broad observer list: on Canton a wide observer list grows the contract and its stakeholder set with every reader, a scaling concern other teams have raised on their own designs, so aggregate or public views belong in an off-ledger reader over emitted events rather than in the parameter contract's stakeholders. Where a Daml-side stack such as the OpenZeppelin reference implementations needs a governed parameter source, these templates are the composition point; the Solidity Registry serves protocols that execute on Zenith EVM, and no synchronous read from Daml into EVM state is assumed.

All three ship with CI test suites exercising governance update flows and emergency-pause paths; simulator-driven recommendation flows are exercised against the EVM pair once the optional tooling lands (final milestone).

### Canton deployment workflow (validated)

Our Canton build-and-deploy workflow is already exercised end-to-end in a public PoC: [woof-software/canton-localnet-poc](https://github.com/woof-software/canton-localnet-poc) builds a DAML package (SDK 3.4.11) and runs it on a live Canton ledger, with the run log and DAR committed as evidence. The risk primitives are drawn from patterns proven on Compound, which we implemented or operate there (see Provenance).

## 3. Architectural Alignment

- **CIP-0100 Dev Fund priorities.** Public good infrastructure, MIT-licensed, deployed permissionlessly.
- **DeFi readiness.** Multiple lending/vault proposals in the open queue need this before mainnet. These open primitives accelerate the entire EVM-side DeFi ecosystem.
- **2026 DevEx Survey alignment.** "Security & Auditing" ranks 24% Critical / 51% Important. Risk parameter management is the **market-level** risk-mitigation layer distinct from code-level audits.
- **Institutional fit.** 83% of projects in the Foundation's 2026 Developer Experience survey (41 respondents) identify as TradFi or hybrid. Institutional CRO offices need transparent parameter governance and stress-test infrastructure.
- **Independent positioning.** Sits in a layer (parameter management) that does not duplicate or require coordination with any single DAML-side team. Friendly co-existence with SafeVault, Risk Ratings, Collateral Control Plane, Hacken — different layers, all useful.
- **2026-2028 roadmap, RFP 13 (Payments and DeFi).** The Foundation's [2026-2028 Strategic Roadmap](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/blob/main/2026-2028-strategic-roadmap.md) asks under Payments and DeFi for "open-source tooling, reference implementations, and standards" for DeFi and liquidity workflows, and specifies that successful proposals "focus on reusable components or standards that can support multiple Canton applications rather than one-off application-specific work". That is this proposal's shape: a parameter registry plus reference implementations that any protocol integrates, MIT-licensed, operated by no one. The RWA Standards RFP (item 12.2) separately lists "Repo, collateral, lending, and servicing workflows"; the registry is the parameter-governance layer such workflows consult.
- **Review Process priority areas.** The [Development Fund Proposal Review Process](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/blob/main/Development%20Fund%20Proposal%20Review%20Process.md) now directs reviewers to weigh alignment with the 2026-2027 Requests for Proposals, and its priority areas still apply: **Security and Resilience** (which lists "security auditing and tooling" and "monitoring, compliance, and third-party audit capabilities") and **App Building and Developer Experience** ("reduced developer friction"). The Risk Engine provides the market-level risk tooling and monitoring every lending or vault protocol needs before mainnet. (Quoted phrases are verbatim from those documents.)

## 4. Backward Compatibility

No backward compatibility impact on existing Canton or DAML systems. The Registry, Simulator, and Dashboard are new components deployed alongside existing protocols. Integration is opt-in — a protocol chooses to register and consult the Registry. Existing deployments are unaffected.

Reference integrations are new code; they do not modify any existing protocol.

---

## Dev Fund 2.0 Alignment

**RFP mapping.** RFP 13, Payments and DeFi, under Financial Markets, Standards & Verification. The proposal supplies the parameter-governance layer that lending and vault workflows need before they can be operated at institutional scale.

**Ecosystem need and beneficiaries.** Every lending market and every curated vault on Canton has to govern the same values: collateral factors, caps, liquidation thresholds, oracle staleness limits. OpenZeppelin confirmed the boundary publicly on 3 September 2026: they ship the baseline parameter surface and its change path, and leave calibration and the risk engine to the operator. Without shared primitives each team rebuilds that layer alone, and each rebuild is a separate audit surface. The beneficiaries are lending and vault protocols on Canton and Zenith, the risk and monitoring parties who have to observe those values, and auditors who currently have no common record of what changed and when. The deliverables are MIT-licensed and severable; the optional tooling lands last.

**Adoption path.** Milestones 1 and 2 are gated on deliverables, since the primitives must exist before anyone can adopt them. Milestone 3 carries one hard adoption gate: at least one external Canton DeFi team has deployed the Registry in a test environment and confirmed it publicly. The reported targets, not gated, are at least one production-track protocol publicly committing to integrate by end of Milestone 3 and at least two evaluating. Tokenisys stated public interest in integrating on this infrastructure, naming two of their own products, and the composition points with OpenZeppelin, RedStone and the Kaiko Data Standard are confirmed in writing and recorded in this file.

# Acceptance Criteria

Milestones 1 and 2 are gated on deliverables, since the primitives must exist before anyone can adopt them. Milestone 3, the optional tooling layer, carries an explicit adoption gate: the ecosystem should not fund tooling on top of primitives nobody is using.

**Hard acceptance criteria (within our control):**
- **Operational readiness:** Both EVM reference integrations operate end-to-end against the Registry, each for its own operations: the vault for deposit, withdraw, parameter update and emergency pause; the lending market for supply, borrow, liquidation, parameter update and emergency pause; the DAML governance example executes its full propose → timelock → execute cycle on a local Canton ledger, and the designated risk-observer party reads the resulting parameter set and execution record through the Ledger API without being a signatory.
- **Reproducibility:** Simulator outputs are deterministic — same inputs produce same outputs, validated by CI golden tests.
- **Documentation completeness:** Migration guide published; reviewed by ≥ 1 protocol team where available, otherwise validated against a Woof reference integration.
- **Security posture:** Solidity contracts pass Slither with zero high-severity findings.
- **Community engagement:** Forum review cycle on canton.network opened; public feedback either incorporated or formally addressed.

**Milestone 3 adoption gate (must be met for M3 acceptance):**
- **≥ 1 external Canton DeFi team** has deployed the Registry from Milestone 1 in a test environment and confirmed it publicly.

**Adoption targets (reported, not gated):**
- ≥ 1 production-track protocol publicly committing to integrate by end of M3, ≥ 2 evaluating.

**Environment note.** Where these criteria reference "Zenith testnet", an equivalent public EVM test environment may be substituted if public Zenith testnet access is not yet available at execution time. The on-chain Registry and reference integrations are standard EVM contracts and the off-chain Simulator/Dashboard are environment-agnostic, so all functional criteria remain verifiable independently of Zenith availability.

# Funding

**Total Funding Request:** $150,000 USD, denominated in Canton Coin at the prevailing USD/CC rate at each milestone's acceptance.

## Payment Breakdown by Milestone

- **Milestone 1** (Registry + governance patterns): $56,250 USD in CC upon committee acceptance.
- **Milestone 2** (Reference implementations — core public good): $52,500 USD in CC upon committee acceptance.
- **Milestone 3** (Optional tooling: simulator + dashboard + handoff): $41,250 USD in CC upon final release and acceptance.

## Volatility Stipulation

[CIP-0100](https://github.com/canton-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0100/cip-0100.md) requires proposals with milestones at or beyond six months to state explicitly how CC price volatility is handled. This proposal handles it by denominating the engineering budget in USD and converting to Canton Coin at the prevailing USD/CC rate on the date each milestone is accepted. Payment is made in CC; no CC amount is fixed in advance, so neither party carries an open-ended exposure to rate movement between approval and delivery.

The rationale is that the cost of the work is a USD cost, and Canton Coin has moved across a wide range in its short trading history. Fixing a CC quantity at submission would make the real value of delivery a function of the rate on an arbitrary date rather than of the work performed. Should the project timeline extend beyond 6 months due to Committee-requested scope changes, any remaining milestones are renegotiated on the same basis.

# Co-Marketing

Upon release, Woof will collaborate with the Canton Foundation on:

- **Announcement coordination** — joint blog post at v1.0 launch.
- **Technical deep-dive** — engineering post on extracting Compound's risk patterns as Canton public goods, published on Canton Foundation channels.
- **Dashboard launch event** — public introduction of the Risk Visualization Dashboard as a Canton DeFi resource.
- **Migration workshops** — 1-2 live sessions with protocol teams during M3, supporting adoption.

---

# Distribution & Go-to-Market

How protocols discover, adopt, and depend on the Risk Engine:

- **Distribution channels.** On-chain Registry deployed at a single canonical address per chain (one integration target for everyone); off-chain Simulator published as an npm package with a Python interop adapter; the Risk Visualization Dashboard hosted publicly by Woof and published open-source for self-hosting; everything under a public GitHub repository.
- **The dashboard is its own marketing surface.** A public dashboard showing every registered protocol's risk state is continuously visible to institutions, LPs, and other builders — adoption by one protocol advertises the Registry to the next. This compounds discovery without paid distribution.
- **Onboarding funnel.** The reference implementations (ERC-4626 vault + simple lending market in Solidity, plus the DAML governance example for Canton-native teams) are copy-paste templates; the "add risk parameter management in 30 minutes" walkthrough and a migration guide for existing protocols are the conversion path. The < 1-hour integration claim is the metric.
- **Targeted adoption.** Direct outreach to the 6 lending/vault teams already in the open queue (Mystic, Cantopy, D2 Finance, Margarita, Meria, Institutional Yield Segmentation) as first integrators — their public integration commitments are tracked as a target adoption metric. Each new lending/vault protocol launching on Zenith is a candidate consumer.
- **Ecosystem alliances.** Registry-emitted events feed neighboring tools (Hacken monitoring, Staking Rewards ratings), so adjacent projects have an incentive to point their users at Registry-integrated protocols — distribution through partners, not just direct.

---

# Rationale

## Why this approach

**Extract and open-source patterns that already work, rather than invent new ones.** The Configurator, CAPO and reserve-growth designs run in production on Compound across multiple chains, and have been through the market conditions that break parameter systems. Generalizing these patterns as Canton public goods is faster, safer, and more defensible than inventing a new risk-management framework from first principles.

**Loosely-coupled layers let teams adopt incrementally.** A protocol can start with the on-chain Registry for governance hygiene and copy from the reference implementations — the core public good — then optionally add the Simulator for parameter recommendations and the Dashboard for public transparency. Each layer delivers independent value; integration cost is opt-in, and nothing downstream depends on the optional tooling.

## Alternatives considered

- **Build a commercial risk-consulting service (Gauntlet model).** Rejected — not a Dev Fund fit. Risk-as-a-service is a private good; open-source primitives are a public good.
- **Build only the on-chain Registry and reference implementations, drop the tooling entirely.** Considered seriously — the registry + reference implementations are the core public good, and the milestone order reflects that (tooling lands last). We keep the simulator and dashboard in scope as optional open tooling because a registry alone gives protocols no open way to inform parameter choices and no public transparency surface — but they are explicitly severable, and nothing in the core depends on them.
- **Defer to a future generalized DeFi framework.** Rejected — no such framework exists or is funded in the queue. The risk infrastructure gap is immediate and concrete.

## Fit with existing ecosystem tooling

This proposal sits at a layer that does not overlap with any single funded or proposed work:

- **OpenZeppelin Canton Stack ([#262](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/262))** — funded Daml reference implementations (DEX, vaults, lending) that ship the baseline parameter surface and its change path: `VaultParams`, `maxStaleness`, `maxDeviation`, the `PriceOracle` interface requirements, role transfer through access control. Calibration is explicitly outside their scope: section 7 of their lending design lists buffer sizing, debt ceilings and insurance-fund stress evidence as open questions for the operator, and on 3 September 2026 OpenZeppelin confirmed the boundary publicly: "We do not own calibration. [...] So your proposal does not overlap with ours. It fills the layer we leave to operators." They named two composition seams: parameter governance, where this Registry with its propose-execute windows and execution-time validation is "a natural author for VaultParams updates", and the oracle interface, which their reference implementations specify but do not implement ([forum reply](https://forum.canton.network/t/9059/6)). We will align on both seams as their implementation starts.
- **RedStone CAPS ([#497](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/497)) and Kaiko Oracle Data Standard ([#113](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/113))** — the price layer. The Registry consumes prices and governs the limits a protocol applies on top of them; it does not produce or distribute price data. A lending protocol on Zenith reads its price from a CAPS feed and its risk limits from the Registry. RedStone confirmed the composition on 2 September 2026 ([reply](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/497#issuecomment-5507825170)), and on 8 September confirmed that their derived capsules will implement the `PublishedQuote` and `DataPoint` interfaces from the approved Data Standard (#113). Those are Daml interfaces, so the composition is direct on the Canton side: the DAML governance example (deliverable 3) consumes `PublishedQuote` and `DataPoint` as its price source, reads `publishedAt` and the quote timestamp from their view and applies its own staleness limit; issuer validity and revocation are not part of that interface and, where an attested value needs them, come from the attestation itself. On the EVM side the Solidity Registry stores an EVM oracle address and feed identifier, and the reference integrations read prices through an EVM-compatible oracle adapter; whether a CAPS-derived feed is available on Zenith EVM through such an adapter, and with which trust model, freshness and decimals, is confirmed with RedStone during M1 rather than assumed from the Daml interface support.
- **SafeVault ([#266](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/266))** — capital flow workflows (entry / allocation / redemption / recovery). Different layer (transaction-level workflows, not parameter management). Natural integration partner.
- **Independent DeFi Risk Ratings ([#131](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/131))** — external AAA-D rating service from Staking Rewards. Different model (rating-as-a-service vs on-chain primitives). The Risk Engine produces the parameters their service could rate against.
- **Canton Collateral Control Plane ([#149](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/149))** — collateral-specific subset. Potential integration point for the Registry.
- **Hacken open-source monitoring ([#302](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/302))** — post-facto observability. Hacken can consume Registry events as a data source.
- **Daml Package Analyzer ([#130](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/130))** — static code analysis. Different domain (code-level vs market-level).
- **Tenderly Simulation for Daml ([#481](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/481))** — transaction-level dry-run simulation before submission. Different domain again: our simulator models parameter-level market risk (price-path replay, Monte Carlo), not individual transaction execution.

## Provenance

Each of the three patterns reaches this proposal by a different route, and the difference is worth setting out.

The reserve-growth tracking stack is our own work end to end, running today against live Compound markets ([backend](https://github.com/woof-software/compound-reserve-growth-backend), [frontend](https://github.com/woof-software/compound-reserve-growth-frontend), [data sources](https://github.com/woof-software/compound-reserve-sources)).

CAPO came out of the Aave ecosystem, where BGD Labs first shipped it ([bgd-labs/aave-capo](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo)), and it is now standard practice for correlated collateral. We brought it to Compound and wrote that implementation: the oracle and its adapter layer for wstETH, rETH, rsETH, ERC-4626 vaults and rate-based sources ([woof-software/compound-capo](https://github.com/woof-software/compound-capo)), with the design discussion on the [Compound forum](https://www.comp.xyz/t/woof-correlated-assets-price-oracle-capo/6245).

The Configurator is Compound Labs' design, and we work with it as operators. Deploying and running Compound markets means driving that update path routinely, which is where our read on its failure modes comes from, and why the reference implementations here treat the parameter update path as the hard part rather than the parameter values themselves.

For a proposal about parameter management, the operating view is the credential that matters, and we would rather set it out precisely than round it up.

## Pre-submission coordination

Low coordination overhead — this is one of the proposal's strengths. No required outreach to any single counterparty. Composition with specific stacks (the OpenZeppelin reference implementations, BitSafe's Decentralization Manager) is delivered as adapters and examples on top of the standalone deliverables, not as a dependency of them.

Light-touch coordination recommended (not blocking):
- Brief forum post mentions to SafeVault (#266), Staking Rewards (#131), Collateral Control Plane (#149), and Hacken (#302) confirming layer boundary alignment.
- Outreach to Mystic, Cantopy, D2 Finance, Margarita, Meria as potential first integrators — public integration intent strengthens M1 / M3 deliverables.
- Review volunteers sought via the `DeFi Protocols & Liquidity` SIG (7 members); the formal Champion comes from the Tech & Ops Committee, per CIP-0100.

# Sustainability

Who operates and maintains the Risk Engine after the grant period:

- **Primary steward: Woof.** Woof commits to maintaining the primitives and reference implementations as part of its ongoing open-source footprint — minimum 6 months of bug fixes, Canton SDK compatibility, and Zenith version updates post-delivery, with security disclosures addressed within 48 hours, plus quarterly review of community feature requests.
- **On-chain layer is self-sustaining.** The Risk Parameter Registry is a permissionless contract with one canonical instance per chain; once deployed it requires no operator to keep functioning. Integrating protocols read from it directly.
- **Dashboard hosting.** Woof hosts the public Risk Visualization Dashboard during and after the grant; because the source is published (MIT) and reads only on-chain Registry events, any party — or the relevant SIG — can self-host an independent instance, so the public good does not depend on Woof's infrastructure surviving.
- **Community handoff path.** All code is MIT/Apache-2.0 with a public issue tracker. Stewardship can transition to or be shared with the DeFi Protocols & Liquidity SIG as it matures, avoiding indefinite single-vendor dependency.

# Team

**Woof** ([woof.software](https://woof.software)) — senior EVM engineers for DeFi. Active Compound DAO contractor team. Every component this proposal generalizes has a verifiable Woof code precedent:

| Risk Engine component | Woof precedent (public artifact) |
|---|---|
| On-chain parameter registry / Configurator pattern | [`comet`](https://github.com/woof-software) — Compound v3 core (Configurator + Comptroller internals) |
| Price-induced risk handling / CAPO oracle | [`compound-capo`](https://github.com/woof-software/compound-capo) — Correlated-Assets Price Oracle implementation by Woof for Compound |
| Reserve growth tracking / operational risk visibility | [Compound Treasury / Reserve dashboard](https://compound.woof.software/treasury) — live Woof-built reserve-and-treasury analytics for Compound DAO; direct precedent for the Risk Visualization Dashboard (Layer 3) |
| Risk-adjusted leverage UI patterns | [`compound-multiplier`](https://github.com/woof-software) |
| Migration of risk-managed positions | [`migrator-v2`](https://github.com/woof-software) — AAVE / Morpho / Spark → Compound v3 |
| ERC-4626 vault precedent | [`comet-wrapper`](https://github.com/woof-software) |

Operational track record: active Compound DAO contractor team, delivering the deployments behind market expansion to Optimism, Mantle, and additional networks. Each market addition involves the full risk-parameter exercise this proposal generalizes.

This proposal is on-chain risk parameter management. We are not proposing to be a security audit firm, static code analyzer, or rating service — those domains belong to Hacken, Certora, and Staking Rewards respectively.
